#### Pull requests and contributing
I am really not interested in having this bot do much more. If you find a bug,
feel free to submit an issue or so on. If it doesn't affect my usage I likely
will not fix it. If you want to make a pull request I will only accept it in 
the case that it comes with tests to check all of the previous test cases. 
Sorry!
